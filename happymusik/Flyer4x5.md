## Format

Below is a **review with targeted edits and clarifications** to make your instructions tighter, unambiguous, and implementation-ready for a designer or PDF-generation workflow. I have preserved your intent and structure, focusing on precision, consistency, and eliminating interpretation gaps.

## Overall Assessment

Your instructions are **strong and well-structured**. They clearly define layout intent, hierarchy, and production constraints. The main opportunities for improvement are:

1. **Consistency of capitalization and imperative tone**
2. **Removal of minor ambiguity** (e.g., logo sizing, margins)
3. **Clear separation of layout rules vs. content rules**
4. **Slight tightening for professional production handoff**

## Instructions (Polished Version)

### Header Layout (Logo + Title)

#### 1. **Logo**

* Positioned **left-aligned** within the header area
* Use the **original logo attached to this request** (no substitutions or redesign)
* Displayed at a size visually balanced with the title text (logo height approximately equal to title cap height)
* Maintain clear margins so the logo does not crowd adjacent text
* Serves as the primary brand identifier

#### 2. **Concert Title**

* Positioned **to the right of the logo**, vertically centered relative to the logo
* Text: **“Holiday Concert”**
* Prominent but not oversized, preserving hierarchy and legibility at small print sizes
* Aligned horizontally with the logo to form a single, unified header block

#### 3. **Overall Header Behavior**

* Logo and title form a **single horizontal row**
* Header begins at the top of the page with a **thin, consistent top margin**
* Combined width fits comfortably within the 4 × 5 inch format with **no wrapping**
* Header reads left-to-right, improving scanability and visual balance

### 4. **Date & Location Block**

* December 21, 2025
* 2:00–3:00 PM
* The Watermark at Bellevue

## Printing Instructions

### Recommended Print Settings

* **Paper Size:** 4 × 5 inches

* **Color Mode:** RGB acceptable; CMYK optional if printer requests
* **Resolution:** Vector content ensures high quality at any DPI

### Paper Suggestions

* **Matte cardstock (80–110 lb):** Preferred for readability and glare reduction
* **Glossy cardstock:** Acceptable but may reduce legibility of thin text
* **Standard paper:** Suitable for proofing or temporary signage

### Trimming

* The file has **no bleed**
* Print at exact size; trimming is not required if printer supports 4 × 5 output
