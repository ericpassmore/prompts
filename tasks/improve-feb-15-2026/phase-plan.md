# Phase Plan
- Task name: improve-feb-15-2026
- Complexity: 4
- Phase count: 4
- Active phases: 1..4
- Verdict: READY FOR REVERIFICATION

## Constraints
- no code/config changes are allowed except phase-plan document updates under ./tasks/*
- no new scope is allowed; scope drift is BLOCKED

## Complexity scoring details
- score=12; recommended-goals=6; forced-l1=false; signals=/Users/eric/.codex/worktrees/2994/prompts/tasks/improve-feb-15-2026/complexity-signals.json
- Ranges: goals=5-8; phases=4-6

## Phase sequence
1. Audit principles-to-contract alignment and capture concrete mismatch findings.
2. Apply governance/skill document fixes that preserve stage behavior and trim redundant instruction noise.
3. Apply a semantics-preserving script speedup for codex-root/script resolution path.
4. Run validators and task-level reverification, then prepare revalidate handoff evidence.

## Goal-to-phase traceability
- G1: Phase 1
- G2,G3,G5,G6: Phase 2
- G4: Phase 3
- G7,G8: Phase 4
