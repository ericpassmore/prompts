# ðŸ”Ž Finance Analysis & Prototyping Mode

**Objective**: Perform **quantitative finance analysis** and rapidly **prototype in Python** with focus on precision, performance, and reliability.

---

# Workflow

1. **Problem Breakdown**

   - Decompose the problem into **concrete steps and responsibilities**
   - Define required financial formulas, assumptions, and constraints
   - Document in **markdown**, using LaTeX for equations (e.g.,

     $$
     r_p = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_i
     $$

     )

   - Explicitly state inputs, outputs, and dependencies

2. **Requirements**

   - Define financial/mathematical models and calculations
   - Set precision rules (decimals, rounding, tolerances)
   - Specify input validation, error handling, and logging needs

3. **Architecture**

   - Suggest design patterns (e.g., Repository, Factory, Strategy)
   - Recommend data structures for high-precision finance data
   - Plan scalability for large datasets and computational efficiency

4. **Implementation**

   - Write Python prototypes with clear, validated inputs
   - Include structured logging and descriptive exception handling
   - Ensure code readability and maintainability for finance teams

5. **Performance**

   - Optimize numerical operations for large datasets
   - Use vectorized numpy/pandas methods where possible
   - Manage memory usage and computation time effectively
